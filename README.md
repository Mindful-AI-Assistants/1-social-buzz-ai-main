## I - [Data-Driven Culture and CRM Data Quality]()  


<br>

☞ [Access Support Material](https://github.com/Mindful-AI-Assistants/social-buzz-ai/tree/f9ed63b2a0508f647aeea3855e0889c0d0c07270/class_1)

<br>


### Embracing a [True]() Data-Driven Culture

<br>

🚫 [**What NOT to do**]()

- Executives decide first, then look for data to support their decisions.  
- Rely solely on instinct or gut feelings to make decisions.


<br><br>



✅ [**What TO do**]()

<br>


- Let data not only indicate *that* a decision is needed but also *which* decision is optimal, based on evidence.  
- Managers and leaders must take responsibility to moderate and validate decisions using what data reveals, rather than personal biases or unsupported opinions.


A true data-driven culture transforms how decisions are made: it places evidence at the center of all strategic and operational choices. This means [building trust in data](), fostering [transparency](), and [encouraging teams]() to adopt analytic [thinking] as a core [mindset]().

<br>


🌱 Leaders play a critical role by modeling data-informed behavior and demanding accountability grounded in facts. When done right, data guides innovation, risk management, and performance, freeing organizations from guesswork and enabling faster, smarter responses to change.


<br>

### [Common Pitfalls to Avoid]()

[-]() Post-hoc justification with data ("data fishing") to back a preconceived decision.  

[-]() Overconfidence in intuition ignoring analytical insights.  

[-]() Lack of data literacy and accessibility, which leads to misuse or mistrust of data.


<br>

### [Data Quality Challenges in CRM Systems]()

Quality of CRM data critically affects the insights used to drive marketing, sales, and customer support efforts.

According to the 2022 study [*"The State of CRM Data Quality"*]() by Validity (a leading provider of email marketing intelligence and CRM data management):

<br>

- [**76%**]() of respondents rated the quality of their CRM data as "good" or "very good". Yet, many still see poor data quality as a barrier limiting new sales opportunities.

- [**79%**]() agree that data deterioration has accelerated at an unprecedented pace, driven notably by pandemic-related disruptions.  

- [⚠️ **75%**]() admit [employees]() sometimes [fabricate data]() to tell the story [they want]() decision-makers to hear, rather than [reflect reality](). 🙂

- Meanwhile, [**82%**]() report pressure to find numbers supporting a specific narrative versus providing accurate, objective information.

<br>

These findings highlight a [paradox in CRM data management](): organizations recognize the importance of [data quality]() but [struggle]() with cultural and operational [challenges]() that [degrade trust]() and [utility]().


<br><br>


### [Key Takeaways for Social Buzz AI Project]()

[-]() Promote *data integrity* and discourage “storytelling” with selective or fabricated data.  

[-]() Foster transparent data governance and regular audits to ensure CRM data accuracy and completeness.  

[-]() Empower teams with tools and training to interpret CRM data critically, using it as a guide rather than a biased narrative.  

[-]() Integrate data quality metrics in your dashboards to continuously monitor and improve CRM data health.  

[-]() Align data-driven practices organization-wide—from executives to frontline users—to build a resilient, trustworthy foundation for marketing and AI initiatives.

<br>

### 🌱 By addressing [both]() the [behavioral shifts]() toward [authentic data-driven decision-making]() and acknowledging the persistent hurdles in [CRM data quality](), your project can help build [powerful, trustworthy]() tools that support smarter, evidence-based marketing strategies.

## II - [Marketing 4.0]()

<br>

<br>

> “Marketing is no longer about the products we sell, but about the connections we create.”
> — *Philip Kotler*

<br>


[**Marketing 4.0**]() is an approach that blends traditional marketing with digital innovations to engage consumers in a more participative, connected, and humanized way. Customers now actively contribute to building brand value instead of being passive recipients. As *Philip Kotler* explains, Marketing 4.0 focuses on authentic relationships and meaningful human connections, empowering marketers to use data and technology as tools, not just ends.

- Customize communications and value propositions for each customer profile.
- Make marketing more personal, relevant, and effective.

<br>

This guide summarizes and explains the essential concepts of market segmentation presented in the attached PDF, focusing on why segmentation matters, how to perform it, important metrics like CLV and RFV, and different segmentation models.

<br>

## [Why Segment ?]()

Segmentation allows companies to identify and prioritize the most attractive market segments and fortify their position within these segments.

- [**Customer Understanding:**]() By segmenting, companies better understand the needs and desires of different customer groups.

- [**Offer Personalization:**]() Enables more assertive offerings and more effective allocation of marketing efforts to the most profitable segments.

- [**Competitive Advantage:**]() Targeted efforts provide greater perceived value, increasing customer loyalty and referrals, which leads to greater market share and profits over time.

- [**Decreasing Marketing Effort:**]() As loyalty grows, less marketing effort is needed for the same or higher profitability.


<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> *"The company segments the market, chooses the best segments, and strengthens its position in these best segments."*  
>
> — Kotler (2021)
>


<br>


## [The STP Model]()

<br>

- [**Segmentation:**]() Identify different audiences.

- [**Targeting:**]() Prioritize the most attractive segments.

- [**Positioning:**]() Create and communicate a competitive advantage for the selected segments.

<br>

[**Virtuous STP Cycle:**]()  

- Marketing focuses on customers’ real needs  

- Customers perceive more value  

- Loyal customers repeat purchase and refer others  

- Market share increases  

- Over time, marketing effort decreases and profits grow

<br>

## [How to Segment ?]() - Bases of Segmentation

<br>

[**1. Psychographic**]()   
- Lifestyles, values, attitudes, opinions

<br>

[**2. Behavioral**]()   
- Attitudes toward products, buying occasions, benefits sought, product usage

<br>

[**3. Demographic**]()   
- Age, gender, family size, income, occupation

<br>

[**4. Geographic**]()   
- Region, municipality size, population concentration, climate

<br>

## [Segmentation by Customer Needs]()

<br>

| [Criteria]()                 | [Small Client]() | [Large Client]()  |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Needs                        | Simpler       | More complex  |
| Avg. Ticket                  | Lower         | Higher        |
| Sales Cycle                  | Shorter       | Longer        |
| Propensity to Churn          | Higher        | Lower         |
| Decision Making              | Rational      | Emotional     |
| Influencers/Decision Makers  | Fewer         | More          |
| Purchase Process             | Simpler       | More complex  |
| Personal Sales Contact       | Less needed   | More needed   |
| Sale Type                    | Shelf sale    | Consultative  |
| Seller Sophistication        | Lower         | Higher        |
| Acquisition Cost             | Lower         | Higher        |
| Customer Value (LTV)         | Lower         | Higher        |


<br>

## [Key Metrics: CLV and RFV]()

### [CLV]()  — Customer Lifetime Value

[**Definition:**]()  
Net profit contribution of a customer across their relationship with the company.

<br>


\[
\text{LTV} = \text{Average Ticket} \times \text{Average No. Transactions/Year} \times \text{Average Years of Relationship}
\]
\[
\text{CLV} = \text{LTV} \times \text{Company Profit Margin}
\]


<br>

[**Example:**]()  

- Annual purchases: 2  
- Avg. spend per purchase: \$1,000  
- Relationship: 5 years

LTV = \( 1,000 \times 2 \times 5 = \$10,000 \)


<br><br>



## IV - [Segmentation - RFV]() (Ressence - Frequence - Value) and [RMV]() (Monetary Value Code and  Project 


<br>

> 


<br>


### [RFV]() — Recency, Frequency, Value

- [**Recency:**]() How recently a customer made a purchase (more recent = higher score)

- [**Frequency:**]() How often customer buys (more frequent = higher score)

- [**Value:**]() How much customer spends (higher value = higher score)


<br>


| [Score]() | [Recency]()                             | [Frequency]()                    | [Monetary Value]()                    |
|----------  |-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 5         | Purchased in last month             | 21–25 times/month                    | Among top 5% spenders                 |

<br>

Customers are segmented by their RFV profile, allowing for tailored marketing and relationship strategies.

<br>

## [RFV Segmentation Example]()

<br>

A 5x5 RFV matrix is used to segment and identify customer groups such as:

- "Champions"
- "Loyal Customers"
- "Promising Customers"
- "Needs Attention"
- "At Risk"
- "Lost"
- "Hibernating"

Each group gets different marketing approaches according to their RFV profile.

<br>

## [CLV vs. RFV]()

<br>

| [Metric]() | [Usage]() | [When to Use]() |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | Measures customer’s long-term value for strategic decisions, targeted marketing, and retention. | When individual customer value is crucial for resource allocation. |
| **Recency, Frequency, Value (RFV)** | Segments customers by recent behavior, for personalized campaigns and identifying best cross/upsell opportunities. | When tailoring communication/campaigns for groups with similar shopping behavior. |

<br>

[**Combined Usage:**[]() 

- RFV segments customers;  
- CLV values each segment for fully-informed marketing and retention strategies.


<br>

## [Segmentation Models]()

### [When Data Is Available:]()

Statistical techniques and Machine Learning can be applied to mine the data and extract business value.

<br>

### [Primary Segmentation Questions]()

1. Are there different customer profiles in our base (if yes, how many)?
2. Among our customers, who is most likely to churn in the coming months?

<br>

### [Types of Segmentation Models ]()

#### 1. [Supervised Learning (Classification & Regression)]()

<br>

- Requires a “teacher” or labeled outcome.

- Answers questions like:
    - Who are loyal vs. non-loyal customers based on demographics?
    - Who is at higher risk of churn?
    - Who is likely to increase spending?

<br>

- [**Example:** ]() 
  - A telecom company builds a churn prediction model based on variables like monthly spend, call-center contacts, delinquency, product count, billing problems, and relationship length.


  <br><br>

#### 2. [Unsupervised Learning (Clustering and Association)]()

<br>

- No target label; seeks hidden patterns and homogeneous groups.

- Answers questions like:
    - What customer profiles exist in our investment portfolio?
    - What cities are similar for marketing test purposes?
    - What school clusters can be formed based on educational indicators?

<br>

- [**Example:**]()  
  - A credit card brand segments its cardholders by the types of establishments where cards are used, resulting in finely differentiated customer groups.


<br><br>


### [Example: Unsupervised Segmentation Profiles]()

<br>

| [Segment]()                    | [% of Base]() |
|--------------------------------|-----------|
| Traveler Elite                 | 0.3%      |
| Basic (supermarkets, gas, pharmacy) | 7.0%  |
| Car                            | 9.8%      |
| Online Shoppers                | 4.7%      |
| High-value Online Shoppers     | 13.5%     |
| Supermarket                    | 11.6%     |
| Retail/High Value Retail       | 8.2% / 2.9%|
| Health/Low/High Value          | 2.0% / 4.0%|
| Various Mixed/Low Segments     | ...       |

<br>

This allows for highly targeted offers based on each segment’s preferences and behaviors.

<br>

## [Conclusion]()

Market segmentation is a fundamental tool for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing customers’ real needs, thereby optimizing marketing resources, building loyalty, growing market share, and increasing profits. The use of advanced metrics (CLV, RFV) and analytic models (supervised/unsupervised learning) enables a data-driven, personalized approach to winning and retaining customers.

## V - [Trees -]() Random Forest Entropy [–]() Test Models & Adjustment Measures

<br>

### [Introduction to Decision Trees]()

- Decision Trees, Classification Trees, and Regression Trees are models that use a response variable to divide data into groups by explanatory variables.
- Each split or node is determined by particular values of an explanatory variable.
- The results are visualized as trees with nodes identifying observation groups defined by specific attribute values.

### [Predicting New Cases]()

- Prediction is performed using hierarchical decision rules derived from the tree.
- Important features are selected through partition search.
- Model complexity is optimized through pruning.

<br>

### [Variable Selection and Splitting]()

- The algorithm searches for useful explanatory variables by testing dichotomous splits based on distinct ordered values of continuous variables.
- For binary response variables, 2x2 contingency tables are formed for each potential split and evaluated using Pearson's Chi-square statistic and associated p-values.
- The "logworth" metric (negative log of p-value) indicates the quality of the split, with higher values indicating more promising splits.

<br>

### [Example Dataset]()

The material includes an example dataset with variables such as:

- Home ownership (Own or Not)
- Marital status (Single, Married, Divorced)
- Income level
- Credit risk (Bad Payer or Not)

This dataset is used to illustrate the tree construction and decision rules.

<br>

### [Splitting Criteria]()

- **Entropy**: Measures uncertainty in a set, calculated as \( H(S) = - \sum p_i \log_2(p_i) \). Pure nodes have entropy 0; balanced classes approach entropy 1.
- **Gini Index**: Measures node impurity, calculated as \( G(S) = 1 - \sum p_i^2 \). Pure nodes have Gini 0; balanced classes about 0.5.
- Entropy tends to create more balanced splits, while Gini is faster and commonly used in implementations like scikit-learn.

<br>

### [Tree Construction Details]()

- Splits must create groups with a minimum number of elements.
- Missing values in explanatory variables are handled during analysis.
- The partitioning process is repeated for all explanatory variables in the training set, building the full decision tree.

<br>

### [Model Evaluation - Confusion Matrix]()

- A confusion matrix compares observed classes with predicted classes.
- Key concepts include True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN).

<br>

### [Performance Metrics]()

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions among total cases, calculated as \( \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \).
- **Recall**: Proportion of correctly predicted positive cases, \( \frac{TP}{TP+FN} \).
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, \( \frac{TP}{TP+FP} \).
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.

<br>

### [Strengths and Weaknesses of Decision Trees]()

- Strengths:
  - Human interpretable and easy to understand.
  - Robust to missing data.
- Weaknesses:
  - Sensitive to small changes in data.
  - Limited in modeling complex relationships.


<br>

### [Random Forest]()

- An ensemble learning technique combining multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance.
- Each tree is trained on a random subset of the training data (with replacement).
- Only a random subset of features is considered for splitting at each node.
- Uses out-of-bag samples for unbiased error estimation.
- Increasing the number of trees generally reduces overfitting unless trees are highly correlated.
